I_out_zero_approx:
	Contains plots that show that assuming I_out = 0 is a good one when dealing with a
	resident at equilibrium density

numerical_communities:
	Contains functions to randomly generate species for the numerical programms

analytical_communities:
	Contains functions to randomly generate species for the analytical programms

numerical_r_i:
	numerically compute the boundary growth rate of species

analytical_r_i:
	analytically compute the boundary growth rate as well as teh chesson terms

investigate_C:
	focus on the ave_C part of the chesson terms and find when these might both be positive

numerical_chesson_terms: #not fully working yet
	numerically compute the chesson terms

mp_approx: #might be not working any more
	Creats plots, that show that the approximation for mp is a good one (see equations)

shortest_periods: #might not be working anymore
	compute the boundary growth rates of very short periods
