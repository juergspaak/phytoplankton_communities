I_out_zero_approx:
	Contains plots that show that assuming I_out = 0 is a good one when dealing with a
	resident at equilibrium density

communities_chesson:
	Contains functions to randomly generate species

mp_approx:
	Creats plots, that show that the approximation for mp is a good one (see equations)

numerical_bound:
	numerically compute the boundary growth rate of species

short_and_long_period:
	analytically computes the boundary growth rates of species

shortest_periods:
	analytically computes the boundary growth rates of species for very small periods
