The subfolder 3_different_pigments contains all programms considering the case of 
constant incoming light with the spectral carbon uptake fucntion.

The files contained are:

load_pigments.py
	loads the absorption spectrum of 29 real pigments
	creates the absorption spectrum of random pigments

multispecies_functions.py
	functions to compute equilibria in the multispecies case

plot_*
	plots the figure with the same name

pig_spe_id.csv
	List of species and pigments. Indicates which species contains which pigments

pigment_data_python.csv
	Contains the absorption spectra of the real pigments
