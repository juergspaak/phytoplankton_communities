Plankton Paradox contains code to test solutions for the plankton paradox. It is split into 3 subfolders:

2_huismann_time:
	Here we test the solution, that several species can survive with light as only limitting factor
	(as in the Huismann model) but with fluctuating light. This question is answered by theoretical
	calculations of the invasion growthrate (Chesson) and with pure numerical analysis.
	Summary: Fluctuating incoming light does not solve the plankton paradox

3_different_pigments:
	Here we test the solution, that different species have different spectrum, hence light should not
	be counted as only one limitting factor, but rather as several resources. We show that the light
	should be counted as more than one resource, but nor as infinitely many.
	Summary: The light should be counted as approximately 5-8 resources. Hardly alows it ever to be
	counted as more than 10 resources. It therefore solves the paradox of the plankton only partially.

4_stomp_time:
	Here we combine the first to solutions into one. We have different species with different absorption
	spectra and fluctuating light (intensity as well as spectrum of incoming light is fluctuating).
	Summary: Not done yet.
